This receives IR sequences and sends them to a recording endpoint on my <a href=https://github.com/judasgutenberg/Esp8266_RemoteControl target=esp8266>ESP8266 Remote backend</a>, storing them in a table called ir_pulse_sequence. You then have to edit that record to make it recognizable when using it to send IR commands to a remote ESP8266 using the rest of that system.
